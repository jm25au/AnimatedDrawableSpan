# AnimatedDrawableSpan
I needed an animation inside of a textview that matched the size of the text contained within whatever the users font size settings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="gif.gif" width="350"/>
</p>

This also means that you don't need to worry about attempting to align an ImageView or something similar with the textview on different resolution devices.
